        <h1>#DisconnectBikeCrime</h1>
        <p>It started with a simple bike ride... until my handlebars and shifter were stolen. The thought of such a violation, the inconvenience, and the cost of replacement was deeply unsettling. But then, I realized I was not alone.</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Bike theft is a major issue in the UK and beyond. Every year, an estimated hundreds of thousands of bikes are stolen, causing significant inconvenience and distress to the victims.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="solution">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>With the advent of new electronic shifter/gear systems on modern bikes, there's an opportunity to revolutionize bike security. What if these electronic components were coded and secured in such a way that if they are paired with a new mobile phone, they confirm the serial number of the unit on the server, and if the unit has been reported as lost or stolen, it disables the device from changing gears until it confirms with the server that the unit is no longer marked as stolen?</p>
        <p>It's a solution akin to "Find my iPhone" - but for bikes. And it's a solution that can help make cycling safer and more secure for everyone.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="call-to-action">
        <h2>Join the Fight</h2>
        <p>We're calling on bike manufacturers and parts suppliers (like Shimano and SRAM) to implement this solution, and on bike owners to demand this level of security from the products they buy. With your help, we can make this vision a reality.</p>

        <h2>Global Impact of Bike Crime</h2>
        <p>Bike theft is not just a local problem - it's a global issue. With estimates suggesting that millions of bikes are stolen worldwide every year, this crime adds up to a billion-dollar problem.</p>
        <p>The issue doesn't just stop at monetary loss. The fear of theft deters people from cycling - about 24% according to a study by Northumbria University, Newcastle, UK. This affects health, the environment, and community wellbeing.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the insurance costs are a burden too. On average, bicycle insurance premiums can range anywhere from £100 to £300 annually in the UK, a substantial amount for many cyclists.</p>
